        <p class="about-text">
            Tic Tac Toe is a classic paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the
            spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical,
            or diagonal row wins the game.
        </p>

        <p class="about-text">
            Tic Tac Toe has ancient origins, with similar games dating back to ancient Egypt. However,
            the modern version of Tic Tac Toe can be traced back to the Roman Empire, where it was played as
            "Terni Lapilli" or "Three Stones." The game gained widespread popularity in the 20th century,
            especially after being included in game theory studies. Today, it is one of the most well-known and
            frequently played strategy games worldwide.
