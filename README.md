## Introduction

Tic Tac Toe is a classic paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

This project implements a digital version of the Tic Tac Toe game, allowing players to play against each other on a web browser.

## History of Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe has ancient origins, with similar games dating back to ancient Egypt. However, the modern version of Tic Tac Toe can be traced back to the Roman Empire, where it was played as "Terni Lapilli" or "Three Stones."

The game gained widespread popularity in the 20th century, especially after being included in game theory studies. Today, it is one of the most well-known and frequently played strategy games worldwide.

## Rules

The rules of Tic Tac Toe are simple:
- The game is played on a 3×3 grid.
- Players take turns marking empty cells with their respective symbols (X or O).
- The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
- If all 9 cells are filled and no player has achieved a winning combination, the game ends in a draw.
